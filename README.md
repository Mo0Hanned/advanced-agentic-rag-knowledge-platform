## Overview

A comprehensive, production-ready **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system built to handle complex enterprise document processing, semantic search, and AI-driven question answering. It leverages LangChain and LangGraph for advanced agentic workflows, orchestrating LLM interactions across various providers (OpenAI, Google GenAI, Groq, Ollama). 

The system relies on a robust architecture featuring FastAPI for high-performance backend routing, React for a dynamic frontend, and a multi-database setup including PostgreSQL (for structured data and RBAC), Redis (for caching and session management), and Qdrant (for scalable vector search). 

## ✨ Key Features

- **Advanced RAG Workflows:** Utilizes LangGraph to power multi-agent reasoning, dynamic retrieval, and context synthesis.
- **Multi-LLM Support:** Seamlessly integrates with OpenAI, Gemini, Groq, and local open-source models via Ollama.
- **Robust Storage Layer:** Combines Qdrant for vector embeddings, PostgreSQL for structured relational data, and Redis for fast caching.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Fully containerized using Docker and Docker Compose for isolated and reproducible environments.
- **Comprehensive Monitoring:** Built-in observability with Prometheus and Grafana for tracking LLM judge metrics and system performance.
- **Interactive UI:** A modern, responsive React frontend built with Framer Motion and Lucide Icons.

## 🏃‍♂️ Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. **Start the Infrastructure (Databases & Services):**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Run the Backend (FastAPI):**
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

4. **Run the Frontend (React):**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

## 🧠 LangGraph Agentic Architecture & Design Choices

The core intelligence of this platform is powered by a multi-agent LangGraph architecture. We carefully designed the agent interactions to maximize reliability and security:

- **Plan and Execute Pattern:** We opted for the "Plan and Execute" approach instead of "Dynamic Replanning" (like the standard ReAct framework). 
  - *Why?* In dynamic replanning, the LLM-based planner is prone to hallucinating, getting stuck in infinite execution loops, or generating an excessively large number of unfeasible plans. The Plan and Execute method ensures a strict workflow where a plan is thoroughly established before execution, significantly increasing system stability and predictability.
- **Guardrails Layers:** We implemented robust guardrail layers across the agents to enforce security policies, validate outputs, prevent prompt injection, and guarantee that the system strictly adheres to constraints and minimizes hallucinations.

## 🚀 Future Work

As the project evolves, the next major phase focuses on achieving high availability, robust CI/CD pipelines, and cloud-native scalability. 

- **CI/CD Integration:** 
  - Implement GitHub Actions to automate code linting, unit testing, and Docker image builds.
  - Automate deployment pipelines for seamless updates.
- **Cloud Deployment (AWS):** 
  - Host the backend and frontend on AWS utilizing services like Amazon ECS or EKS for container orchestration.
  - Migrate local databases to managed cloud services (Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL, Amazon ElastiCache for Redis) to ensure data durability and automated backups.
- **Auto-Scaling & Load Balancing:** 
  - Configure Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) and Application Load Balancers (ALB) to handle variable workloads dynamically, ensuring the application remains highly responsive during traffic spikes.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** 
  - Use Terraform or AWS CDK to provision and manage the cloud infrastructure reliably and consistently.
